ASCOM Platform Components via NuGet
===================================

This repository contains a copy of the compiled binaries taken from the ASCOM Developer Components installer
together with a `.nuspec` file for creating a NuGet package.

This package can be easily installed when developing ASCOM drivers or applications and allows development
to proceed without having to install the ASCOM Platform.

This is probably of most use when using a build server, where it is burdensome to have to install ASCOM
on each build agent.

No originality is claimed, this is simply an alternative mechanism for distributing the binaries from the ASCOM Platform.

This is a derivative work and the binaries are redistributed with permission, under the Creative Commons license of the ASCOM Platform.
